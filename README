Module API:

[Module] sxml.css-sxpath

    This module offers the function that converts the CSS selector into the
    converter of SXPath. The following CSS selectors are supported.

        E, F, ...
            Element that matches to either of two or more selectors

        E
            The element with the specified name

        *
            All elements

        E[att]
            An E Element with a "att" attribute

        E[att='val']
            An E Element whose "att" attribute value is exactly equal to "val"

        E[att~='val']
            An E element whose "att" attribute value is a list of
            whitespace-separated values, one of which is exactly equal to
            "val"

        E[att|='val']
            An E element whose "att" attribute has a hyphen-separated list
            of values beginning (from the left) with "val"

        E[att^='val']
            An E element whose "att" attribute value begins exactly with the
            string "val"

        E[att$='val']
            An E element whose "att" attribute value ends exactly with the
            string "val"

        E[att*='val']
            An E element whose "att" attribute value contains the substring
            "val"

        E[att1][att2]...
            An element that matches to two or more attribute selectors

        E.foo
            An E element whose class is "foo"

        E#foo
            An E element with ID equal to "foo"

        E:first-child, E:last-child
            The first E element and the last E element.

        E:nth-child(an+b)
            After E element is divided into the group of a piece, and
            selecting the bth element of each group. The a and b values must
            be integers (positive, negative, or zero). :nth-child() can take
            'odd' and 'even' as arguments instead. 'odd' becomes a meaning
            that 2n+1 and 'even' are the same as 2n. The index of the
            element starts from 1.

                E:nth-child(2n+1)    E elements of odd number
                E:nth-child(odd)     same
                E:nth-child(2n)      E elements of even number
                E:nth-child(even)    same
                E:nth-child(0n+5)    The fifth E element(if a=0, only match bth element)
                E:nth-child(5)       same

        E:enabled
            An E element whose "enabled" attribute value is "true" or
            "enabled", or "disabled" attribute value is "false"

        E:disabled
            An E element whose "disabled" attribute value is "true" or
            "disabled", or "enabled" attribute value is "false"

        E:checked
            An E element whose "checked" attribute value is "true" or
            "checked"

        E:not(s)
            An E element that does not match simple selector s except :not()
            itself.  Therefore, s may not be nested; :not(:not(...))

        E F
            An F element descendant of an E element

        E > F
            An F element child of an E element

        E + F
            An F element immediately preceded by an E element

        E ~ F
            An F element preceded by an E element

    Please escape ":" in the backslash when you contain the colon in the
    element name with namespace prefix.

        ((css-sxpath "rss\\:title") '(*TOP* (rss:title "foo")))
        => '((rss:title "foo"))


[Function] css-sxpath selector . ns-binding

    Selector is a list or string. It is converted into the converter of
    SXPath for string with the CSS selector or XPath. Each element is
    converted into the converter at the list by the following rules, and it
    is brought together in one converter by node-or.

      (or (symbol? elt) (procedure? elt)) => (sxpath elt)
      (or (string? elt) (pair? elt)) => (css-sxpath elt)


There are some wrapper functions as well as the sxml.sxpath module.

[Function] if-css-sxpath selector

    Instead, if-css-sxpath returns #f though css-sxpath returns the empty
    list when the node is not found. 


[Function] if-car-css-sxpath selector

    Returns first node found, if any. Otherwise return #f.

[Function] car-css-sxpath selector

    Returns first node found, if any. Otherwise returns empty list.
